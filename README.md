## Day 27  
Picking up after the practice project i am going to dive into Fragments, Portals. A common problem and a JSX limitation is a so called 'div soup'. In order to avoid that i will create a wrapper component and replace my already existing div. After that i will start to use and manipulate portals learning the meaning of controlled and uncontrolled components.
